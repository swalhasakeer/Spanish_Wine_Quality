# **Wine Quality**



## 1. Goal of the Dataset

 To analyze wine ratings, price variations, and customer preferences based on wine attributes like body, acidity, and type.

## 2. Description of Dataset

 This dataset is related to red variants of spanish wines. The dataset describes several popularity and description metrics their effect on it's quality. The datasets can be used for classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (i.e. the quality goes from almost 5 to 4 points). The task is to predict either the quality of wine or the prices using the given data.
